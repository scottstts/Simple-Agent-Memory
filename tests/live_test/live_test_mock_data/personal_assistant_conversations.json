        {"role": "user", "content": "Hi Kai, I'm Morgan. Just got you set up on my machine. I'm a senior backend engineer at Stripe, been there about two years now."},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hey Morgan, nice to meet you. Happy to help however I can. Stripe — that's a great place to be. What kind of work do you focus on there?"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "I'm on the payments infrastructure team. Mostly working in Go, some Python for tooling and data pipelines. We run everything on AWS."},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Got it — Go for the core infra, Python for tooling, AWS underneath. Makes sense for payments scale."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah exactly. Oh and I use Neovim as my main editor, tmux for everything. I know it's old school but I can't go back."},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Nothing wrong with that — plenty of people swear by that setup for good reason."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "I'm on an M2 MacBook Pro for work and I have an Arch Linux desktop at home that I use for personal projects and gaming."},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Nice combo. I'll keep both environments in mind when suggesting anything."}

        {"role": "user", "content": "Hey, random question. I'm trying to get better about mornings. Right now I wake up around 7:30 and just immediately check Slack, which I hate."},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah that's a common trap. What would an ideal morning look like for you?"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "I'd love to run first thing. I used to run 5Ks pretty regularly, haven't in months. And then maybe read for 20 minutes before work."},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's doable. Would you want me to help you build a schedule around that? Like a 6:15 alarm, run by 6:30, back and showered by 7:15, reading until 7:45?"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "That sounds great actually. My partner Jamie gets up at 6 anyway so I wouldn't be waking anyone."},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Perfect. I'll note that down. Do you run outdoors or treadmill?"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Outdoors when the weather's okay. We live in Portland so rain is frequent, but I don't mind running in light rain. If it's really pouring I'll do a bodyweight workout at home instead."},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Makes sense. Portland rain is more drizzle than storm most of the time anyway."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Exactly. Oh and I should mention, I have a slight knee issue on my left side. My PT said I should avoid steep downhill running and do quad strengthening exercises twice a week."},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good to know. I'll keep that in mind if I ever suggest routes or workouts."}
